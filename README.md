# Is the LacI-AraC dual feedback oscillator robust?
The work is aimed at reproducing and doing some analysis on the paper "Engineered temperature compensation in a synthetic genetic clock", https://www.pnas.org/content/111/3/972
We make a computational model of the dual feedback, synthetic oscillator and through analysis of different parameters, find whether the oscillator is robust or not.

Here are some pictures(from the slides only):

### Differential Equations that the oscillator follows(Hussain et.al, PNAS 2014):
